<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle braking systems market includes two primary types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes use brake shoes that press outward against a rotating drum to create friction and slow the vehicle. They are cost-effective and commonly used in rear wheels. Disc brakes utilize brake pads that clamp onto a rotor, offering better heat dissipation and performance, especially in high-speed or heavy-duty applications. Disc brakes are more efficient and widely used in modern vehicles, while drum brakes remain prevalent in budget or lighter-duty vehicles.</p></p>
