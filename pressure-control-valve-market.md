<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Control Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Moving Valve</li><li>Pilot Operated Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pressure control valve market features two primary types: straight-moving valves and pilot-operated valves. Straight-moving valves directly control the flow and pressure by moving a disc or plug in response to pressure changes, offering a simple and reliable solution for applications requiring quick response. In contrast, pilot-operated valves utilize a smaller pilot valve to manage a larger primary valve, allowing for greater flow rates and improved precision. These distinctions cater to diverse industrial needs, enhancing system efficiency and safety.</p></p>
