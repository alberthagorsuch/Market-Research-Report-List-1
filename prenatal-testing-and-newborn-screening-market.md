<p><h1>Prenatal Testing and Newborn Screening Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2024 to 2031)</h1></p><p><strong>Prenatal Testing and Newborn Screening Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Prenatal testing and newborn screening are essential components of maternal and infant healthcare, aimed at detecting potential genetic, metabolic, and developmental disorders early in pregnancy and after birth. Prenatal testing includes procedures such as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), chorionic villus sampling (CVS), and amniocentesis, which help assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities. Newborn screening typically involves blood tests to identify conditions like phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital hypothyroidism, enabling timely interventions that can significantly improve health outcomes.</p><p>The Prenatal Testing and Newborn Screening Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.20% during the forecast period. This growth is driven by rising awareness among expectant parents, advancements in genetic testing technologies, and supportive government initiatives promoting early disease detection. Additionally, the increasing prevalence of genetic disorders and a growing focus on personalized medicine are shaping market dynamics. With the integration of artificial intelligence and digital health solutions, the industry is witnessing innovative approaches to data analysis and patient management. As healthcare systems prioritize preventive care, the demand for comprehensive prenatal and newborn screening solutions continues to rise, creating new opportunities for market expansion.</p></p>
